```python
class JobAnalyzerAgent:
    def analyze_job_description(self, job_description: str) -> dict:
        prompt = f"""You are an expert HR analyst. Analyze this job description and extract the 5 most critical skills and the top 3 responsibilities. Output this as a structured JSON object with two keys: 'skills' (a list of strings) and 'responsibilities' (a list of strings).

        JOB DESCRIPTION:
        ---
        {job_description}
        ---

        Output JSON:
        """
        
        response = ollama.chat(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}],
            options={'temperature': 0.3}  # Low temperature for consistency
        )

## 🔗 **4. Vector Search & Embeddings**

### **Purpose**: 
Uses AI embeddings to find relevant experience from the master resume.

### **How It Works**:

```python
class ResumeProcessor:
    def ingest_resume(self, resume_content: str):
        # 1. Chunk the resume
        chunks = self._chunk_resume(resume_content)
        
        # 2. Generate embeddings for each chunk
        for chunk in chunks:
            response = ollama.embeddings(model=Config.EMBEDDING_MODEL, prompt=chunk)
            embedding = response['embedding']
            # Store in ChromaDB
        
    def retrieve_relevant_experience(self, query_text: str, n_results: int = 5) -> list[str]:
        # 1. Generate embedding for the query
        query_response = ollama.embeddings(model=Config.EMBEDDING_MODEL, prompt=query_text)
        query_embedding = query_response['embedding']
        
        # 2. Find similar chunks using vector similarity
        results = self.collection.query(
            query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
            n_results=n_results,
            include=['documents']
        )
```
